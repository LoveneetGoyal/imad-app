               This is the content.Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are slightly crosslinked liquid crystalline polymer networks. These materials combine the entropy elasticity of an elastomer with the self-organization of the liquid crystalline phase. In liquid crystalline elastomers, the mesogens can either be part of the polymer chain (main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers) or they are attached via an alkyl spacer (side-chain liquid crystalline elastomers)
